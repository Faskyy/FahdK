        As an upcoming graduate aspiring to find a full-time career in Software Engineering, I enjoy being part of the intersection of technology and design, contributing to society's technical advancements.  I am a designer, a coder, and a passionate thinker, aiming to create experiences that would allow people to flow
        through an aesthetically pleasing world of science, technology and art.

      <strong>When I'm not working</strong>, I enjoy shopping at Whole Foods, looking at pictures of corgis and watching Brooklyn 99.
       I also love listening to Disclosure, Young The Giant and all sorts of other music.
